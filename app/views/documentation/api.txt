== Item Registration

To allow easy creation of the structures necessary for recoding an objects data the API supports a one stop setup request.  A POST request is made with an XML request of the required structure.  WhatHappened attempts to match existing structures; creates any necessary new structures and returns XML populated with id's.

An item must exist before item registration can be used to update the structure.
